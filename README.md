<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a database and user (homestead, sqlite or mysql)
3. If not using [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead) or Valet - you will need to configure permissions on `storage` and `bootstrap/cache`. See [Laravel 6.x Installation](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x) for more info.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit to local settings
5. `composer install`
6. `php artisan key:generate`
7. `php artisan migrate --seed`
8. `php artisan passport:install` to create keys and client
9. `chmod 600 ./storage/*.key` to set permissions correctly
10. Add the "password grant client" id and secret to your `.env`
11. Install npm packages for webpack (JS and Sass) builds: `yarn install`
12. Run `yarn watch` in the background during development to automatically compile assets when modifying code or changing commit

We suggest that you use the TLD `.test` as others, like `.app` may now be in the public domain and you will experience difficulty with respect to browser behavior over HTTP/HTTPS.

## Docker

There is a self building docker file in the root of the repo. Full docker instruction are [here](DOCKER.md). Environment variables that can be ovvrriden can be found in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile). 

## Setting up reporting

This project can run reports at set times using the Artisan scheduler. This requires some means of periodic triggering. Add to crontab the following:

`*/20 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/{path_to_install}/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

We will also need a directory at `storage/app/enc` set to `chmod 770` permissions for {appropriate_user}:{webserver_group}

where

- {path_to_install} with the deploy location.
- {appropriate_user} with an appropriately qualified local user
- {webserver_group} with the webserver's group.

It also requires PHP's `zip` extension installed and enabled.

### To use the Reset data buttton on the dashboard:
 - chown `env` to the console user and web user group e.g. `chown neontribe:www-data .env`
 - And `chmod 775 .env`

 - Reseed with `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed`
 - Run tests with `phpunit`

### Styling

#### Service

- Service styling is in `resources/assets/sass/app.scss`
- When amending the styles in development, switching to a new branch or pulling code, run `yarn watch` to watch for changes
- Service is compiled from Sass with `yarn prod`
#### Store
- Store styling is in `public/store/css/main.css`
- Run `yarn dev` to make sure packages Store shares with Service have been included.

## Deployment

1. `./makedeploy.sh ARCVService_v<x.y.z>(-[beta|RC]X)`
2. copy the tgz file up to the server
3. login and move to the correct folder
4. `./deploy-service ARCVService_v<x.y.z>(-[beta|RC]X).tgz service_v<x.y.z>(-[beta|RC]X)`
