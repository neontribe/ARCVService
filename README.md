# ARCV Service

## About ARC Voucher Service/API
ARCV Service is the service portal and API for ARCV Market.

## Installation of Development instance

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a database and user (homestead, sqlite or mysql)
3. If not using [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead) or Valet - you will need to configure permissions on `storage` and `bootstrap/cache`. See [Laravel 6.x Installation](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x) for more info.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit to local settings
5. `composer install`
6. `php artisan key:generate`
7. `php artisan migrate --seed`
8. `php artisan passport:install` to create keys and client
9. `chmod 600 ./storage/*.key` to set permissions correctly
10. Add the "password grant client" id and secret to your `.env`
11. Install npm packages for webpack (JS and Sass) builds: `yarn install`
12. Run `yarn watch` in the background during development to automatically compile assets when modifying code or changing commit

We suggest that you use the TLD `.test` as others, like `.app` may now be in the public domain and you will experience difficulty with respect to browser behavior over HTTP/HTTPS.

## Versioning, branching and tags

Use [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning. Each sprint is considered a minor release until the customer asks for a major, non backwardly compatible re-write.

### Sprint development

 * Find the trello card and grab the URL, e.g. `https://trello.com/c/P5aKkOWJ/2056-market-roll-up-repo`
 * Create a branch off develop that uses the ticket number and title, e.g. `dev/2056-market-roll-up-repo`
 * Work on the ticket
 * Raise a PR into develop
 * Add a link to the PR into the Trello card
 * Wait for at least one approval on the PR
 * Merge and delete branch

### Create a Release candidate

 * Tag develop with the incremented release number, e.g. `git checkout develop && git tag v1.16.0-rc.1`
 * Push the tag, `git push --tags`
 * Release to staging

### Creating a Release

 * Merge `develop` into `main`
 * Tag main with a release, e.g. `git checkout main && git tag v1.16.0`
 * Push the tag, `git push --tags`
 * Release to live

### Hotfix

 * Find the trello card and grab the URL, e.g. `https://trello.com/c/P5aKkOWJ/2099-HOTFIX-something-is-broken`
 * Create a branch off **main** that uses the ticket number and title, e.g. `hotfix/2099-HOTFIX-something-is-broken`
 * Work on the ticket
 * Raise a PR merging into **main**
 * Add a link to the PR into the Trello card
 * Wait for at least one approval on the PR
 * Merge and delete branch
 * Once testing is passed create a release with an incremented patch number e.g. `git checkout develop && git tag v1.16.1`
 * Release main to staging *This will change when we are containerised*
 * Test on staging *This will change when we are containerised*
 * Cherry-pick the hotfix commits back into develop
 * Release to live


## Setting up reporting

This project can run reports at set times using the Artisan scheduler. This requires some means of periodic triggering. Add to crontab the following:

`*/20 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/{path_to_install}/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

We will also need a directory at `storage/app/enc` set to `chmod 770` permissions for {appropriate_user}:{webserver_group}

where

- {path_to_install} with the deploy location.
- {appropriate_user} with an appropriately qualified local user
- {webserver_group} with the webserver's group.

It also requires PHP's `zip` extension installed and enabled.

### To use the Reset data button on the dashboard:
 - chown `env` to the console user and web user group e.g. `chown neontribe:www-data .env`
 - And `chmod 775 .env`

 - Reseed with `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed`
 - Run tests with `phpunit`

### Styling

#### Service

- Service styling is in `resources/assets/sass/app.scss`
- When amending the styles in development, switching to a new branch or pulling code, run `yarn watch` to watch for changes
- Service is compiled from Sass with `yarn prod`
- 
#### Store

- Store styling is in `public/store/css/main.css`
- Run `yarn dev` to make sure packages Store shares with Service have been included.

## Deployment

1. checkout the release tag, `git checkout v<x.y.z>`
2. `./makedeploy.sh ARCVService_v<x.y.z>(-[beta|RC]X)`
3. copy the tgz file up to the server
4. login and move to the correct folder
5. `./deploy-service ARCVService_v<x.y.z>(-[beta|RC]X).tgz service_v<x.y.z>(-[beta|RC]X)`
6. update the `.env` file
