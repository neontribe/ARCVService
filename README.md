# ARCVService
## About ARC Voucher Service/API
ARCV Service is the service portal and API for ARCV Market.

## Installation of Development instance

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a database and user (homestead, sqlite or mysql)
3. If not using [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/homestead) or Valet - you will need to configure permissions on `storage` and `bootstrap/cache`. See [Laravel 5.5 Installation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5#installation) for more info.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit to local settings
5. `composer install`
6. `php artisan key:generate`
7. `php artisan migrate --seed`
8. `php artisan passport:install` to create keys and client
9. `chmod 600 ./storage/*.key` to set permissions correctly
10. Add the "password grant client" id and secret to your `.env`

We suggest that you use the TLD `.test` as others, like `.app` may now be in the public domain and you will experience difficulty with respect to browser behavior over HTTP/HTTPS.

## Setting up reporting

This project can run reports at set times using the Artisan scheduler. This requires some means of periodic triggering. Add to crontab the following:

`*/20 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/{path_to_install}/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

We will also need a directory at `storage/app/enc` set to `chmod 770` permissions for {appropriate_user}:{webserver_group}

where

- {path_to_install} with the deploy location.
- {appropriate_user} with an appropriately qualified local user
- {webserver_group} with the webserver's group.

It also requires PHP's `zip` extension installed and enabled.

### To use the Reset data buttton on the dashboard:
 - chown `env` to the console user and web user group e.g. `chown neontribe:www-data .env`
 - And `chmod 775 .env`

 - Reseed with `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed`
 - Run tests with `phpunit`


### Styling
#### Service 
- Service styling is in `resources/assets/sass/app.scss`
- When amending the styles in development, run `npm run watch` to watch for changes
- Service is compiled from Sass with `npm run prod`
#### Store
- Store styling is in `public/store/css/main.css`

## Deployment

1. Travis will build and test with every push to the repo.
2. Travis will deploy to staging `https://arcvservice-prealpha.neontribe.org` with every merge to default branch. When default branch is updated, change value in `.travis.yml`.

## CI deploy with Travis set up notes

1. Install travis cli tool wih `gem install travis`
2. Log in to travis cli with `travis login` using git token or creds
3. Create a `.env.travis` that is in `local` env with user `travis` and no password for database.
4. Create `.travis.yml` as per one in this repo without the `env:global:secure:` vars and without the openssl encrypted info. If you are setting up a new config - we need to encrypt and add those values.
5. Use travis cli to encrypt vars and add them to .yml e.g. `travis encrypt STAGING_USER=mickeymouse --add` for `$STAGING_USER` and `$STAGING_IP`.
6. Create an ssh key and `ssh-copy-id -i staging_key.pub` to server. Encrypt the private half and add to the .yml with `travis encrypt-file staging_key --add`
7. delete the `staging_key` and `staging_key.pub` from your machine - don't need them anymore.
