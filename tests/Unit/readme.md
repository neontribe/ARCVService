This directory contains unit tests for Models Commands, Listeners, Routes and Controllers.

A test should be created for every new function added to a Model, Command, Listener or Controller.

A test should be created for every new route implemented.

There is some crossover with controllers and acceptance/ feature - so open to discussion.
